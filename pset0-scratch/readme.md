## Inspiration 

- Tried to turn a classic film scene into a mini game. 
- 2001: a space odyssey, or Blade Runner as a 2D platformer game. 
- 2001 was the final choice because the Scratch stage dimension is small. 2001 scene is geometric and minimal, which gives a clean aesthetic.  

## Imprementation 

- Starfield background is rotating as if viewing from Earth. 
- All sprites rotate as if they are floating in the space. 
- Bone obstacle moves randomly. 
- Monkey obstacle chase towards the Astronaut.
